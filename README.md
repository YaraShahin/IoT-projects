## Project: SmartRolls
Many elders and physically disabled people live in households that will require a guardian to be monitoring them all the time. That's why we introduce the Smart Wheelchair for Elders. The Smart Wheelchair aims to make life easier for patients and always help better monitor them. This wheelchair will help the patient maneuver without help via line following technology, monitor their health and vital signs remotely, and alert the guardian in case of emergencies regarding the patient’s wellbeing. The wheelchair will carry the patient to designated rooms inside the house/apartment. The wheelchair will also monitor the patient’s temperature and heart rate and send those readings to the patient’s guardian via a cloud service.
